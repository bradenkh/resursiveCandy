# Recursive Candy project
This program asks the user how much money they want to spend, and tells them how many candies they can buy.
---
The idea is that the user can initially buy candies, 
but for every three wrappers they have they can trade them for a new candy.
I wrote this program because it seemed like a fun way to play with recursive functions.
